THE COMPLETE CODE IS INSIDE COMPLETE_CODE.ipynb.,.. i also separated the codes into extract_data.ipynb - to extract the data from the database, label_coment.ipynb - to extract a portion of the extracted data
i inserted two methods for labelling the data but i commented out the method involving using chapgpt 3.0 api. it was commented out because i had exceeded the free quota that will enable to label the comment.
the train_test.ipynb can be use to test new coments
